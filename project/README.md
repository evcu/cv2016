#Torch-Pruner 

This is my final project for the Computer Vision class thought by Rob Fergus in Fall 2016. I got the project of implementing compressing ideas of Song Han presented in paper `Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient Neural Networks`. Brief summary of my-work and results can be found [here](https://evcu.github.io/)
